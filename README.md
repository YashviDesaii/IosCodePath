# My project idea - 
An application that combines the best features of Slack and Trello to create a seamless and efficient communication and project management experience for teams. The app's clean and intuitive interface allows users to create channels for different projects or topics, where they can send real-time messages and collaborate with team members. Users can also create Kanban boards within channels for managing tasks and projects. The goal is to help teams stay connected, focused, and productive

## Notes

One of the challenges I faced while building the application was to get familiarized with Xcode. The software, on first glance, can be a bit overwhelming but as I read through the instructions, it became more intuitive. My overall experience was smooth and exciting!
